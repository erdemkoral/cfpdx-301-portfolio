# This my read me

For portfolio5 assignment, Christy, Andrew and I worked together today.
First I created a new javascript file (appView.js) to hold some of the functions related with page view.
Second, fixed a minor bug in teaser function that triggered the read more/ read less feature on all of the articles when it is only needed to work on that specific article that triggered.
We also corrected some indentation problems, tried make the code look bit more proper.


Note:
Unfortunately I started the portfolio assignment without reading the requirements, and assumed that portfolio5 assignment was about form building. Added some features for form building. Please disregard those when you review the code.
