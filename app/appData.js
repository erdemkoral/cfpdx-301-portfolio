One thing about White Leghorn, they chicken out easily (pun intended).</p>'

They are best in a confined setting, like a penned in area or a coup, but under the right circumstances, they also make good free range birds. However, their coats are fluffy and retain moisture, so they will always need a place of shelter, and they do not fly very well, so if they are free ranged, predators might become an issue.</p>'
